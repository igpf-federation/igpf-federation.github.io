# Updating GP and iHub pages

Unfortunately, github pages doesn't support the Ruby Gem that generated these pages. Therefore, if you wish to update them

Install dependencies:

```
gem install bundler jekyll
```

Build the site:

`bundle exec jekyll build`

Look in the `_site` directory.
Copy the folders `gp` and `ihub`, and paste them in the root firectory.
