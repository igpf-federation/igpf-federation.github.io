				<h2>What is I:HUB?</h2>
				
				<p>I:HUB is a Primary Care service that enables Islington registered NHS patients to see an Islington GP or nurse for routine care at a time or place that suits them. If you can&rsquo;t get an appointment at your local practice or you can&rsquo;t easily get there, say because you are working, you can simply ask your practice for an I:HUB appointment in stead of your usual GP.</p>
				
				<p>It is open every Monday to Friday evening 6.30pm to 8pm, 8am to 8pm every weekend, and Bank Holidays. Simply ask your usual GP reception for an I:HUB appointment.</p>

				<h2>What appointments are offered?</h2>
				
				<p>Any Islington NHS-registered patient can book a future or same day appointment to see a local GP or nurse, who will have full access to your record (subject to your consent).</p>

				<p>They offer the same care at hub locations as your usual GP: usual health problems, routine check ups (asthma, smears, diabetes, COPD, contraception), dressings, childhood or travel immunisations.</p>

				<p>Just phone or visit your usual GP and ask about I:HUB appointments.</p>

				<h2>Will my medical record be accessed?</h2>

				<p>Yes. You will be asked to give your consent when you book or visit, so that the local GP or nurse can give you the best care, just like at your usual practice. Your hub consultation will be saved into your record, along with any prescriptions, referrals or further action, so that your usual GP is always kept up to speed.</p>

				<p>Your consent is only for the consultation / appointment you have booked. You will be asked to provide consent each time you visit an I:HUB clinician.</p>

				<p>Hub staff will confirm your NHS number and usual Islington GP practice when you arrive for your appointment.</p>
