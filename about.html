				<p><span class="header">I:HUB was</span> created in October 2015 by Islington GPs in order to test if Islington patients would be interested in seeing Islington GPs and nurses during weekday evenings and throughout the weekend, in addition to their existing GPs. The pilot has shown that Islington patients are happy to see doctors and nurses outside their usual practices if it means they get the right care at the right time and place, and with a clinician who knows the area.</p>

				<p>I:HUB clinics are provided across Islington from five locations. Each site houses an existing busy practise during the day, already providing routine care for Islington patients. I:HUB takes over the facilities during weekday evenings and throughout each day of the weekend.</p>

				<p>The pilot has been funded by NHS England and is set to become a permanent Primary Care service from April 2017.</p>

				<h2>The best routine care for you and your family</h2>

				<p>I:HUB uses local GPs and nurses who already work in the area. Most already work in Islington practices - as do the I:HUB reception teams. They know Islington patients well. Our doctors and nurses require you to give consent  for them to access your full medical record so that they can provide you with the best possible routine primary care. All consultations are passed back to a patient's home practice in real time using the latest clinical technology.
				
				<p>I:HUB is owned and run by Islington GPs, who have come together to offer an even better level of primary care than exists in Islington already. Islington GP Federation is a collaboration between 29 of Islington's 34 GP practices. I:HUB aims to help Islington practices to provide access to Primary Care from  8am to 8pm seven days a week.</p>

				<h2>Why would I book an I:HUB appointment?</h2>

				<p>If an evening or weekend appointment is more convenient for you and your family, then an I:HUB appointment might suit you. Do you live at one end of Islington and work at the other. If so, it might suit you to go to an I:HUB  clinic near to your work place now and again. Or maybe as a daytime carer the only opportunity you have for yourself is on a Saturday or Sunday.</p>
				
				<p>These are just some of the situations in which you might find it convenient to book an I:HUB appointment, either in advance or on the same day. The  I:HUB service is designed to help Islington patients to continue to get the best  routine health care, even when their usual GP practice is closed.</p>
